# My Scrimba Projects 🚀

This repository contains a collection of projects I’ve built while learning web development on Scrimba. Each project focuses on strengthening my understanding of core concepts like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frontend practices.

The goal of this repo is to track my progress, experiment with new ideas, and build a solid foundation through hands-on coding.
